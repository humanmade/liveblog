This React app allows for Live Blogging on a WordPress site using the REST API.

## Requirements
Locally, this requires Node with npm.

The server you are connecting to requires the WP REST API v2 plugin to be active, and the OAuth 1.0a and Broker plugins to authenticate and use write methods.

## Installation
This repository is a static site that connects to a REST API-powered site.

To run the application, clone the repository, install dependencies with `npm install`, then run `npm start` to run a local development server. This will start the application on port 3000, so access http://localhost:3000/ to view the application.

## Contributing
Please feel free to fork and use this app on your own

## License
This app is licensed under the MIT or later.
